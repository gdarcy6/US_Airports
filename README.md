# US_Airports

This app is an enhanced version of the interactive mapping tool originally developed by Appsilon, as demonstrated in their blog post here. Utilizing the airports.csv dataset from Kaggle, I began with the template provided by Appsilon and implemented several additional features to improve user experience and functionality.

In the original template, the map automatically started with one airport selected, which limited initial user interaction. I modified this feature to allow users to choose their initial starting point, offering greater flexibility. Additionally, I introduced a counter and a dynamic table that displays the number of airports per state as selections are made, providing real-time insights.

To further enhance usability, I added a "Clear Selection" option under the state input selection, as well as a "Select All" option for more efficient data handling. The overall airport counter, which updates in real-time, is conveniently located beneath the "Clear Selection" button.

Moreover, the map remains fully interactive, utilizing Leaflet, as demonstrated by Appsilon. These added features and improvements are highlighted in the accompanying video, showcasing the app's enhanced functionality and user experience.
